# Model Transformation Tool Prototype

This folder contains all the information related to the model transformation strategies developed during this project. Here, you will find mainly two things:

- The prototype developed as a Model Transformation Tool for this project and that can be used to transform PSS/E models into Modelica representations along with an XSLT file that allows CIM models created from PSS/E representations to be translated into Modelica models. 

- Documentation regarding the transformation of CIM models into Modelica representations by using an XSLT file. Note that for completing this translation, it would be necessary to have an XSLT engine which is not currently offered with the tool and it is not wrapped into the Python application.
