PSS/E files of the 500-bus system (beta version)

SHO 2021-07-10: The files under CIM is from the intial version of the 500-bus
The file [nypa_500_cleaned.raw](\nypa_500_cleaned.raw) give the following error message when importing to PSS(r)ODMS: [PSSEtoCIM_nypa_500_cleaned.log](\CIM/PSSEtoCIM_nypa_500_cleaned.log)
I also tried to open it with PSSE 35.1.0 and got the following log [PSSE_35_1_OpenLog.txt](\CIM\PSSE_35_1_OpenLog.txt)

So it looks like the file is not "perfect."
