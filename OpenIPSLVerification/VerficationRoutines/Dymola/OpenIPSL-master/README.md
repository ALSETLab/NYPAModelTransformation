# **OpenIPSL**: Open-Instance Power System Library:
The OpenIPSL or Open-Instance Power System Library is library of power system component models written in the [Modelica](http://modelica.org) language that can be used for power system dynamic analysis, such as phasor time-domain simulations. 

OpenIPSL is currently developed and maintained by Prof. [Luigi Vanfretti's](https://github.com/lvanfretti) research group [ALSETLab](https://github.com/ALSETLab) at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://rpi.edu), Troy, NY, collaborators and friends, such as [Dietmar Winkler](https://github.com/dietmarw) and [FOSSEE](https://om.fossee.in/fellowship2018) (contributions are welcome!).

## Scope
The purposes of OpenIPSL are to be used for research and education (therefore frequent release times may be available), with maximum compatibility with [OpenModelica](http://openmodelica.org/) (to provide a free/libre and cost-free alternative for power system dynamic simulation), to provide as many as possible typical "test networks" for use in research and teaching, and to be developed in such way that the library can efficiently be used for power system simulation within Modelica-based workflows (i.e., helping to give reference power system models for development and testing of Modelica back-end compilers) when faced with power system simulation challenges.

## Documentation:
Please follow this link to our [**documentation**](http://openipsl.readthedocs.io/).

Tutorials on OpenIPSL have been given at many conferences, and are available under [Release](https://github.com/SmarTS-Lab/OpenIPSL/releases).
We recommend you start from there.

Our documentation assumes that you have working knowledge of the Modelica language, are familiar with a Modelica-compliant modeling and simulation environment, that you have proeficient knowledge on power system steady state analysis (i.e., the so called "power flow"), and knowledge on power system dynamic modeling (i.e., the called "transient" and "small-signal" stability).

As such, the documentation is limited, and aims to provide very consice information for people who fulfill the requirements above.

If you do not fulfill these requirements, we recommend that you first get acquainted with both Modelica and Power Systems.

Additional details about many of the models in OpenIPSL are available in disparate sources. Some of these are a reflection of the results from the efforts of many students that have worked with  Prof. [Luigi Vanfretti](https://github.com/lvanfretti).

See our [Publication List](http://openipsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/publications.html) for more details on the models available.

In addition, you can also browse a few of the MSc thesis of the students that carried out their MSc and PhD research under Prof. Vanfretti's group in the following links:

We would love to develop a detailed documentation, however, the development of OpenIPSL is being carried out in "best effort" basis by the project contributors.

If you want a better documentation, and are willing to pay for our time to develop it, get in touch with use through the "Issues" feature in Github.

## Notice to Users:
This project encompasses the development of a Modelica library for power system simulation.
As such, there are no solver tools provided in this repository (no Power Flow Solvers, no Time-Domain solvers, etc.).
You can find more information in our [**documentation**](http://openipsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/get-started.html).

The OpenIPSL contains the models developed by SmarTS Lab during the iTesla project, and necesssary models that were publically released or implemented by RTE and AIA, that we can maintain properly.
Note that several models have been removed from those that are available in iPSL (see [here](https://github.com/OpenIPSL/OpenIPSL/pull/10)).
We have removed all models that are dependent on a specific software tool from the power systems domain that we don't have access for Software-to-Software validation, and those that require us to have access to closed (and expensive) standards that we don't have money to buy in order to maintain them (i.e., IEC Wind Turbine models).

## Contributing:
Contributions to the library are welcome and can be submitted in the form of pull requests to this repository.
Contributions can be of different nature, such as addition of a new component model, re-organisation of the structure of the library, change in the development practices, etc.

Please consult the [contribution guidelines](http://openipsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/contributing.html).

More information about our contributors can be found over [here](http://openipsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/community-home.html).

## Citing OpenIPSL in Publications:
If you use OpenIPSL in your work or research, all we ask you in exchange is that you **cite the reference publications**, according to your use.
Please consult our [Publication List](http://openipsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/publications.html), for browsing the reference publications.

## History
The iPSL is a [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org) library developed during the [iTesla project](http://www.itesla-project.eu/).
The members of this project (OpenIPSL) at SmarTS Lab (now [ALSETLab](https://github.com/ALSETLab)) where key developers of the iPSL until March 31, 2016, when the iTesla project was completed.
Prof. [Luigi Vanfretti](https://github.com/lvanfretti) lead the development of a large amount of the models of the library (particularly those that replicate results from PSAT and PSS/E).
iPSL is part of the [iTesla Tool](https://github.com/itesla/ipst), and thus, it is subject to the needs of the consortium that develops the iTesla Tool.
Therefore, the SmarTS Lab / ALSETLab team decided to create the OpenIPSL fork in order to develop the library in a direction that is more suitable for researchers and teachers/professors, and in a transparent, open source software approach.
