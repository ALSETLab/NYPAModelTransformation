Project Contributors
====================

The iPSL
--------

The original library (iTesla Power System Library, iPSL) was developed by the consortium behind the `iTesla project`_, with the following partners:

- RTE: http://www.rte-france.com/
- AIA: http://www.aia.es/en/energy/
- SmarTS Lab, KTH: https://www.kth.se/en
- DTU: http://www.dtu.dk/english

Since the end of the iTesla project, the project has been forked into the OpenIPSL project by the SmarTS Lab research group.
Our goal is to foster a larger community and include external collaborators to the development of the library.
