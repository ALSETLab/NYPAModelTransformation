## Notes
- These scripts were done using Dymola 2020 and OpenModelica 1.13.0.
- These scritpts are made for the latest release of the OpenIPSL library found at: https://github.com/OpenIPSL/OpenIPSL .
- Make sure that you change the file location to the ones of your computer.
- These scripts will only work using Ubuntu, if Windows is needed you need to change the structure of the files and the dymola installation location. 
- It is easier to debug and change file directory using Jupyter Notebook and its files (.ipynb).
- To use the code just run the .py scripts.
- The results(for the ESAC1 exciter) (.csv files) will appear under: .../WorkingDir/Exciters/ESAC1/
