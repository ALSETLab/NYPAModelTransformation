title: Model Transformation Tool
---

This is the website for the 'Model Transformation for High Performing Smart Grid Applications' project. It is a joint project between New York Power Authority (NYPA) and AlsetLab at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). This project was developed between August 2019 and August 2021.

## Project Overview

With the upcoming changes in the energy landscape of New York State, new modeling capabilities and simulation tools will be required in order for renewable and distributed energy technologies to be properly studied and incorporated into the electricity grid. In today's environment, grid modeling and operation in New York State are limited to few specific and proprietary software tools traditionally used for modeling and simulation over many decades. The ability of introducing new tools has been impractical, due to the way models have been developed and maintained. By using interoperable standards, and technologies, this project creates a new basis for developing and transforming grid models, facilitating the utilization of multiple tools to advantage of the best features each tool has to offer in order to support the engineering and decision making process driven by the NYS Energy Plan and NY Reforming the Energy Vision (REV).

More information about the project, some of its results and its outcomes can be found in the different pages of this website.
